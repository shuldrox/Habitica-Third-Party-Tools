# Notify Party Leader for Inactive Members

This script will notify the party leader when a member is inactive in their party.

## Detailed Description:
Every day, this script will send the last logins for all the party members, and whether they were in the tavern or not. If a user goes beyond their party's restrictions, their name will be highlighted in pink and/or they will be auto-kicked.

## Steps for Installation:
NOTE: When I say "Set the variable `var_name` to `x` on line `n`," it means: Find the place on line `n` where it is written `const VAR_NAME =` and then there should be a value, and then a semicolon `;`. Change the value between the `const VAR_NAME =` and `;` to `x`.

1. Create a new project in [Google Scripts](https://script.google.com).
2. Title your project "Notify Party Leader for Inactive Members". (optional step)
3. Remove all intial text. ("yourFunction")
4. Copy and paste [Code.gs](Code.gs) into the file.
5. Replace the text (on line 4) `PasteYourUserIdHere` with your user id, which you can find [here](https://habitica.com/user/settings/api). (leave the quotes).
6. Replace the text (on line 5)`PasteYourApiTokenHere` with your api token, which you can find [here](https://habitica.com/user/settings/api). (leave the quotes).
7. Set the variable `INACTIVE_DAYS_TO_NOTIFY_AFTER` on line `10` to whatever fits the 'x' in the following sentence: I'd like to know (and/or kick) if a party member member has been inactive for more than 'x' days.
8. Set the variable `WHERE_TO_POST_NOTIFICATIONS` on line `11` to `NONE` (leave the quotes) if you'd like to be notified only in your PMS, to `DEFAULT` (leave the quotes) if you'd like to be notified in your PMS and in the party, and to a guild id (leave the quotes), if you'd like to be notified in that guild id, and in the PMS.
9. Set the variable `AUTO_KICK` on line `12` to `true` (no quotes) if you'd like members who exceed your parties expectations to be automatically kicked, and set it to `false` (no quotes) if you'd not like members to be automatically kicked.
10. Set the variable `DISABLE_IN_TAVERN` on line `13` to `true` (no quotes) if you'd like members who exceed your parties expectations but are in the tavern to be overriden. Set this to `false` (no quotes) if you don't want this feature. (NOTE: It is recommended that, if you set `AUTO_KICK` to `true`, that you set this to `true` as well.)
11. Use âŒ˜ + S to save your project, or click the save button ![save button](https://snipboard.io/DStH86.jpg).

13. Click the run button ![run button](https://snipboard.io/UCAtuH.jpg).
14. If you see message that begins with an `ERROR: `, check what the message is saying and try to fix the values of the variables from lines 4-13; fix this before you continue, and if you can't fix it, DM [me](https://habitica.com/profile/7748a67a-a485-4808-91d7-fdba18d6075b) and I'll try to help you.
