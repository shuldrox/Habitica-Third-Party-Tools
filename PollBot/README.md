# PollBot
This bot helps to manage polls in a guild and track users' votes on the polls.

## Detailed Description:
Once PollBot is in the guild, it can be used to track polls. A poll consists of a title, its status (OPEN or CLOSED, determines whether users can vote on it or not), the options, and the number of votes for each option.
PollBot works in a way such that to run a command, you must send a message into the guild starting with `@PollBot`, a space, and the command name. Here is a brief overview of the commands (you can also find this overview and more detailed by using `@PollBot help`):

* open: The **open** command creates a poll. Use `@PollBot help open` for detailed info on the syntax & more.
* vote: The **vote** command lets a user vote on a poll. Use `@PollBot help vote` for detailed info on the syntax & more.
* show: The **show** command lets a user see the results of a poll. Use `@PollBot help show` for detailed info on the syntax & more.
* close: The **close** command lets a user close a poll so that no one can vote on it. Use `@PollBot help close` for detailed info on the syntax & more.
* re-open: The **re-open** command re-opens a poll after it has been closed. Use `@PollBot help re-open` for detailed info on the syntax & more.
* list: The **list** command lists the polls in a guild. Use `@PollBot help list` for detailed info on the syntax & more.
* version: The **version** command shows the current version PollBot is running in a guild. Use `@PollBot help version` for detailed info on the syntax & more.

**IMPORTANT!!: This third-party app DOES save your user ids to recognize users and save poll data. It is important to note that PollBot cannot perform any actions with user ids; user ids are just for user recognition!**
IMPORTANT!!: Please keep 30 seconds in between commands to avoid rate-limiting and lag.

## Version and Updates:
Occasionally, a new version of PollBot will come out. You can use the `@PollBot version` command to see the version you have. You can visit [@PollBot](https://habitica.com/profile/be465863-8705-415b-8688-951ac97e5d3d)'s profile page for the latest PollBot version. It is not necessary to update, but if you would like to update, you can use this trick (not guaranteed to work, but works most of the time):
First, remove PollBot. Next, wait 48 hours. Then, re-add PollBot.

## Steps for Installation:
Simply invite the user [@PollBot](https://habitica.com/profile/be465863-8705-415b-8688-951ac97e5d3d) to the guild! It may take 24 hours or longer for PollBot to accept your invitation.

## Troubleshooting:
If you experience in problems installing or using PollBot, please send a private message describing your problem to [me](https://habitica.com/profile/7748a67a-a485-4808-91d7-fdba18d6075).

It is important that at times when the PollBot server is extremely busy, PollBot may be rate-limited and lag or not send messages at all. If PollBot doesn't send a message, be sure to check whether your action has already been done.
